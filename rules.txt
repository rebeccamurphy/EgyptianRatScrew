Rules of Egyptian Rat Screw:

Player 2 (human) goes first.
A player makes a move my touching their deck. 

Cards are placed on the center pile. 

A player can slap the center pile when there is a sandwhich (the top three cards form a pattern of Card Rank 1, Card Rank 2, Card Rank 1) or a double (top 2 cards for a pattern of: Card Rank 1, Card Rank 1)

When a facecard is played, the next player has a certain amount of chances to play another facecard or get a slap, other wise the player that put down the face card originally gets the pile.

Ace: 4 chances
King: 3 chances
Queen: 2 chances
Jack: 1 chance

The goal of the game is to make the opposing player run out of cards, so they are no longer able to play.
